# Fukushima2044
Fukushima 2044 is a single-player, tactical, top down, pixel, survival/shooter game developed by William Yang and Christine Wei using the PyGame module. The game is set in the city of Fukushima, Japan in the year 2044. 

Amid political unrest in Japan, a biological facility explodes in Fukushima, prompting the government to set up a quarantine area and evacuate everyone nearby. As this happens, all hell breaks loose as factionalism within the very guards protecting the containment zone turn against each other and the military’s many factions start fighting for their respective faction. As the biological facility is locked down, they all fight for control of it to get whatever pathogens remain - some of the extremist groups want to use them as leverage for the future. Two months later, 2044, the city of Fukushima is deserted and has become militarized. The main character (the player) is an operative working for the CIA to secure the vials so that they may leave the area.
